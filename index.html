              Fairchild Tax Service is operated by Halford and Heather
              Fairchild. Halford does all of the taxes, as he has been doing
              since 1985. Fairchild Tax Service was founded by Yuri Fairchild
              (1909-2004) in the 1940s, and Halford was her typist in the 1960s!
              This year, Marcus Fairchild is joining the team as an apprentice
              and future owner!

              COVID taught us that the fastest and most efficient way to serve
              you is like a shoe repair person (or the cleaners). Drop documents
              off and come back when your returns are ready in two or three days
              (longer waits in April, and if you come on the deadline, you
              missed it). Even better, scan your docs into a preferably single
              page PDF and send to our email. We always discuss your situation
              by phone to find your best bottom lines. Turnaround times are 1-3
              days in February, 5-10 days in March, and 10-15 days in April
              (anyone who comes in April will likely miss the April 15th
              deadline, but our approach is one where missing the deadline is no
              big deal).

              We are up and running and working full time from now through May.
              As noted above, we urge you to file early and to send relevant
              documents by email, fax, or drop-off, and we will contact you
              within days. In unusual cases, we will prepare the returns “while
              you wait” (those involve people who are traveling long distances
              to drop off).

            <h2 class="text-center mt-0">What is new for the 2025 Tax Year?</h2>
            <hr class="divider" />
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              The tax code changes in a lot of areas every year. For the 2025
              tax year, the biggest things to look for are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Child Credits</strong> have increased from $2,000 to
                $2,200 for eligible children (those under 16).
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>“Standard Deductions”</strong> increased for all
                taxpayers; and Seniors over 65 get an extra deduction for their
                seniority. (Helps people who do not itemize.)
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Trump Account.</strong> Babies born in 2025 are eligible
                for a “Trump Account” (yes, that’s what it is called), which is
                $1,000 deposited into a tax deferred account. Get this: Report
                the newborn on Form 4547!
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>No tax on tips!</strong> For most people who receive
                tips as part of their wages (up to a limit of $25,000).
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>No tax on overtime!</strong> If your W2 shows overtime –
                or your pay stub – there is a deduction to make it tax free
                (within limits).
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>State and Local Tax (SALT)</strong> deduction limit
                increased to $40,000. This is huge! The previous limit was
                $10,000. Expect larger refunds for middle and high income
                people.
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Form 1099-DA.</strong> For crypto currency transactions.
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Form 1099K.</strong> For self-employed persons, and many
                others, Form 1099K reports income transactions from “payment
                apps” such as Venmo, PayPal, and CashApp. If you receive one or
                more 1099-K, be sure to send to us with your other tax
                documents.
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Forms 1099-NEC.</strong> 1099-NEC forms report income
                from consulting or independent contract work and must be
                reported in your tax return. Be sure to itemize and add up the
                expenses you incurred in generating this income.
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Forms 1099-R.</strong> These forms report retirement
                distributions. If you took an early withdrawal, new rules make
                these withdrawals exempt from the 10% federal penalty.
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Forms 1099-C.</strong> These forms report “cancelled
                debts” which are treated as taxable income, unless you declare
                bankruptcy or insolvency (insolvency happens when your debts
                exceed your assets). Cancelled student loans are not taxable.
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Electric Vehicle Credits.</strong> For tax year 2025, EV
                Credits have been transferred to the dealer. However, if the
                dealership gives you IRS Form 15400, show it to us because it
                may help your bottom line. EV credits were eliminated, entirely,
                for vehicles purchased after September 15, 2025.
              </li>
              <li class="text-muted mb-4">
                <strong>Identity Theft Protections.</strong> One way to avoid
                Identity Theft in taxes is to obtain an IP PIN (Identity
                Protection Personal Identification Number) from the IRS website
                (<a href="https://www.irs.gov/" target="_blank">www.irs.gov</a
                >). (The only downside is that you’ll need a new IP PIN every
                year.)

              We offer tax services all year, but our strongest advice is to
              FILE EARLY. As the deadline approaches, our turn-around time
              extends to five or more days. We urge everyone to file early and
              avoid the days immediately before the deadline -- otherwise expect
              longer wait time. As you can see from our photo gallery, Heather
              and I like to travel in the "off season," but we're never gone for
              more than two or three weeks, and we will announce those
              departures on our answering system and website. We play the World
              Series of Poker every year in late June to early July (Heather
              finished in 239th place out of 5,404 entrants in the 2020

              General Instructions on Filing Remotely with Fairchild Tax Service
            </h5>

            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              We have found remote tax preparation faster and more efficient
              than the traditional “in person appointment.” If you call for an
              appointment today, you get one in two or three weeks (or
              whenever); if you submit your documents remotely, you get an
              answer in three or four days! (Longer in April.) We always discuss
              tax returns that have (or require) maneuverability.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              <strong>NEW CLIENTS:</strong> Please send a scan of drivers’
              license of taxpayer and spouse (if relevant), names, SSNs and
              dates of birth of all dependents, and previous year tax return (if
              available).
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              <strong>MAIL/DROP-OFF GUIDELINES:</strong> Mail copies of your tax
              documents to our address or drop off in either the upper or lower
              mail boxes at the front of our building (5352 W. Pico Blvd., LA,
              CA 90019).
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              <strong>EMAIL GUIDELINES:</strong> We prefer a single, multi-page

              The best way to answer this question is to say, “Our fees range
              from $0.00 to $2,000, depending on the specifics; but most of our
              clients make money when we do their taxes.” Please take the

              use a calculator).

              <strong>Answers:</strong> The correct answer is “c” for each of
              the four questions. (“A penny saved is a penny earned.”) The
              simplest tax returns range from $10.00 to $200.00; returns with
              1099s and other peculiarities range from about $300 to $800; and
              returns that are complex, or require magical intervention range
              from $400 to $2,000. But most of our clients
              <strong>make money</strong> by having us calculate their debt to
              Uncle Sam.
