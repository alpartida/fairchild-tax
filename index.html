              COVID taught us that the fastest and most efficient way to serve

              About “Extensions.” We have concluded that extensions to file are
              mostly a waste of time. An “extension” is an extension to file,
              not an extension to pay. If you expect a refund, you do not even
              need an extension – the IRS will pay you interest on your refund
              if you file late. If you do owe them, you must pay what you owe
              with the extension, or make your best guess. Anyone who still
              desires an extension can do it yourself by downloading Form 4868
              at the IRS website (IRS.GOV).

              Notice to New Clients, March 19, 2024 Due to high demand from our
              existing clientele, we are asking new clients to contact us on or
              after May 1, 2024. Yes, this is after the April 15th deadline; but
              do not panic as the “deadline” is not real: You can file any day
              of the year. (Except from mid-November to mid-January, when the
              IRS e-file portal is closed.) With more than 80 years of
              experience in this family business (this is Dr. Fairchild’s 39th
              year as tax preparer), we have learned all the nooks and crannies
              of the tax code and can help optimize your bottom lines. If your
              tax situation is even mildly complex, or you think you owe the IRS
              more than you like, then we can definitely help you. But we are
              booked solid through the end of April. New clients must wait until
              the first week of May to be served. We offer tax services all year
              long.

            <hr class="divider" />
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              The Covid Pandemic (1920-21) affected our business in a very
              positive way: We learned how to do taxes remotely, and the
              extended deadlines in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 gave us a lot of
              time to attract more clients.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              In fact, our business has attracted hundreds of new clients over
              the past few years, and we already had hundreds of clients. It is
              human nature to test the boundaries of deadlines, and we have
              witnessed a growing influx of requests for service in the past
              week.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              The line of people waiting service, as of this writing, is about
              12 days. It stretches well beyond the April 15, 2024 “deadline,”
              and will grow even longer as the 15 th approaches.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              This means that anyone getting in line, now or in the coming days,
              will be processed in late April, after the deadline. This is not a
              problem for any of my clients – they either get a refund (so there
              is no deadline) – or I so drastically reduce the IRS debt that any
              late penalties are trivial.
            </p>

            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              <b>New Clients.</b> New clients are urged to wait until after
              April 15 th to be served. Even then, you will be getting in a line
              that will be about 10 days long. We offer tax services all year
              long.
            </p>
            <h2 class="mt-0">About the IRS Deadline and Extensions</h2>
            <hr class="divider" />
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              Whenever we get near the IRS tax filing “deadline,” people who
              have procrastinated all this time start to panic:
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              “Oh, my God! I have to get my taxes done, the deadline is next
              week!”
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              The filing deadline is not really real. The IRS will let you file
              the day after the deadline and the day after that and, in fact,
              every day of the year. If you miss the so-called tax “deadline,”
              absolutely nothing happens if you have a refund coming. In fact,
              the IRS will pay you “interest earned” on the refund they owed you
              since the so-called “deadline.”
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">But what if you owe the IRS?</p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              If you owe the IRS, and miss the deadline, you will owe them a
              little bit more. That little bit more is not enough to go into a
              panic attack. Besides, anyone who owes the IRS, and comes to us to
              do your taxes, will owe a lot less.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              So, to all the people who are about to miss the “deadline,” or who
              have already missed the deadline – don’t worry. Rather than do
              your taxes in a mad rush, just wait until after the so-called
              “deadline.” You can do your taxes later. You will be glad you
              waited because you will be working with me, someone who many of my
              clients call a “magician.”
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              A lot of people hearing this message will ask for an “extension”,
              because they procrastinated so long that they cannot possibly make
              the tax filing “deadline.” (That applies to anyone reading these
              letters.)
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              Here is our standard answer for a request for an extension,
              especially immediately before the so-called deadline:
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-0">“No!”</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              We don&#39;t do extensions because they are mostly a waste a time,
              and when we are near the deadline, time is the last thing we have
              to waste.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              To do an extension, properly (according to IRS rules), we would
              have to receive all of the relevant tax information, calculate
              your bottom line, and have you pay what you owe with the
              extension.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              There is obviously no time for that – your money is too funny and
              you have procrastinated too long! But don’t worry! Anyone who
              knows how we do taxes knows that we can reduce your tax bill
              significantly, by exploring the nooks and crannies of the tax
              code.
            </p>
            <h3 class="mt-0">So, no, we do not file “extensions.”</h3>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              If you feel that you really need one, do it yourself at
              <a href="https://www.irs.gov/" target="_blank">IRS.GOV</a>
              (download Form 4868, fill it out, and mail it in. If you don’t
              send money with the Form 4868, you just wasted your time.)
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              And to all of the people who are “new” to our service, just wait a
              few weeks, until about a week or two after the so-called
              “deadline,” and we will be happy to serve you and make your tax
              dreams come true! We do taxes all year long, except during the
              occasional vacation.
            </p>

              We offer tax services all year, but our strongest advice is to
              FILE EARLY. As the deadline approaches, our turn-around time
              extends to five or more days. We urge everyone to file early and
              avoid the days immediately before the deadline -- otherwise expect
              longer wait time. As you can see from our photo gallery, Heather
              and I like to travel in the "off season," but we're never gone for
              more than two or three weeks, and we will announce those
              departures on our answering system. We play the World Series of
              Poker every year in late June to early July (Heather finished in
              239th place out of 5,404 entrants in the 2020 "Seniors" event; Hal
              contributed to the prize pool.)

              General Instructions on Filing Remotely with Fairchild Tax Service
            </h5>

            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              We have found remote tax preparation faster and more efficient
              than the traditional “in person appointment.” If you call for an
              appointment today, you get one in two or three weeks (or
              whenever); if you submit your documents remotely, you get an
              answer in three or four days! (Longer in April.) We always discuss
              tax returns that have (or require) maneuverability.
            </p>

              <strong>DO NOT BRING OR SEND BACKS OF W2s OR RECEIPTS!</strong> We
              are not the IRS and we are not auditing you. Just add up your
              numbers and tell us the total.

            <p class="text-muted mb-4">
              <strong>NEW CLIENTS:</strong> Please send a scan of drivers’
              license of taxpayer and spouse (if relevant), names, SSNs and
